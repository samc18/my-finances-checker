                <p>Tips Needs</p>
                <p>50% of your income: needs. Necessities are the expenses you can't avoid. This portion of your budget should cover required costs such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Housing.</li>
                    <li>Food.</li>
                    <li>Transportation.</li>
                    <li>Basic utilities.</li>
                    <li>Insurance.</li>
                    <li>Minimum loan payments. Anything beyond the minimum goes into the savings and debt repayment bucket.</li>
                    <li>Child care or other expenses that need to be covered so you can work.</li>

                <p>Tips Wants</p>
                <p>30% of your income: wants. Distinguishing between needs and wants isn't always easy and can vary from one budget to another. Generally, though, wants are the extras that arenâ€™t essential to living and working. They're often for fun and may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monthly subscriptions.</li>
                    <li>Travel.</li>
                    <li>Entertainment.</li>
                    <li>Meals out.</li>

                <p>Tips Savings</p>
                <p>20% of your income: savings and debt. Savings is the amount you sock away to prepare for the future. Devote this chunk of your income to paying down existing debt and creating a financial cushion.</p>
                <p>How, exactly, to use this part of your budget depends on your situation, but it will likely include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starting and growing an emergency fund.</li>
                    <li>Saving for retirement through a 401(k) and perhaps an individual retirement account.</li>
                    <li>Paying off debt, beginning with high-interest accounts like credit cards.</li>
                </ul>
